# uBlock-Personal-Filters

A comprehensive personal filterlist of mine with additional filters for uBlock Origin to block third-party, tracking, annoyances, anti-adblock, popunders, resource-abuse and all other unwarranted resources from loading.

Contains filters specific to uBlock Origin and some filters that have not yet been added to other filterlists.

Add the list from here: [subscribe](ubo:subscribe?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uBlock-user/uBO-Personal-Filters/master/uPF.txt&title=uBO-Personal-Filters)

# Requirements 

Need to add [uBO-Scriptlets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uBlock-user/uBO-Scriptlets/master/scriptlets.js) to `userResourcesLocation` parameter in `Advanced-Settings` in uBlock-Origin for **some** filters to work.

# Disclaimer 

As this is a **personal** filterlist of mine, there maybe some filters that you disagree with and if you do, feel free to click on the **fork** button and make your own list.
