# uBlock-Filters

A filterlist of mine with additional filters for uBlock Origin to block third-party, tracking, annoyances, anti-adblock, popunders, resource-abuse and all other unwarranted resources from loading.

Contains filters specific to uBlock Origin and some filters that have not yet been added to other filterlists.

# Requirements 

Need to add [uBO-Scriptlets](https://ubo-scriptlets.pages.dev/scriptlets.js) to `userResourcesLocation` parameter in `Advanced-Settings` in uBlock-Origin for **some** filters to work.

# Disclaimer 

There maybe some filters that you disagree with and if you do, feel free to click on the **fork** button and make your own list.
